ansible-vagrant-windows-wp
==========================

This is an Ansible Vagrant configuration for provisioning a Wordpress development environment on Windows.

I wanted to run roots/bedrock-ansible provisioning script on Windows but you can't do that yet (Ansible is in the process of creating a native Windows client).

So I found a work-around.

The bootstrap.sh came from KSid/windows-vagrant-ansible.

The Ansible setup comes from roots/bedrock-ansible
